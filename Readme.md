# Malware Classifier

Malware Classifier is a simple classifier project done for a course. Here I compare different Machine Learning models and how they perform on the task of classification.

Check the [Report](https://github.com/AyushiChuriwa/Malware-Classifier/blob/main/Report-Machine%20Learning%20for%20Software%20Development%20Project.pdf) for the comparison.

## Usage

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Train the model using NeuralNetwork.ipynb

Test the classifier using project.ipnb


Unseen labels may change the test accuracy.
