# Malware Classifier

Malware Classifier is a simple classifier project done for a course. Here I compare different Machine Learning models and how they perform on the task of classification.

Check [a relative link](Report-Machine Learning for Software Development Project.pdf)  for the comparison.

## Usage

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Train the model using NeuralNetwork.ipynb

Test the classifier using project.ipnb


Unseen labels may change the test accuracy.
